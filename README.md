# Project Overview
For this project, I will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks. I will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, I will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

# Project Objectives
Objectives we want to find out from the datasets:
  * What is the distribution of conservation status for animals?
  * Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
  * Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
  * Which species were spotted the most at each park?

# Data
This project has two data sets that came with the package. The first csv file has information about each species and another has observations of species with park locations. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project. Note: The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional. Both Observations.csv and Species_info.csv was provided by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).

# Findings
* What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
    - The vast majority of species were not part of conservation.(5,633 vs 191)
* Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
    - Mammals and Birds had the highest percentage of being in protection: 17% and 15.4% respectively.

* Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
    - While Mammals and Birds did not have significant difference in conservation percentage, mammals and reptiles exhibited a statistically significant difference.
* Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?
    - The study found that bats occurred the most number of times and they were most likely to be found in Yellowstone National Park.

# Further Research
This dataset only included observations from the last 7 days which prohibits analyze changes over time. It would be curious to see how the conservation status for various species changes over time. Another piece that is missing is the Area of each park, it can be assumed that Yellowstone National Park might be much larger than the other parks which would mean that it would exhibit more observations and greater biodiversity. Lastly, if precise locations were recorded, the spatial distribution of the species could also be observed and test if these observations are spatially clustered.
